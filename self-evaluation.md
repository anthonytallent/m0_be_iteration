# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
<br> I am decently confident with the each method, however I plan on practicing it some more.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
<br> For the most part it was productive struggle. luckily both google and the classmates were fantastic sources of information.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
<br> Realistically I am going to practice this concept more, but I do feel as though I have effectively learned it.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
<br> How complex can .each go? seeing it used practically would be cool. I might google it or possibly ask a friend of mine who works in the field to show me something with it that might help in the long run.
